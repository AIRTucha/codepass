# Codepass 

## Overview

The Codepass CLI tool evaluates the maintainability of code and provides recommendations. It generates two main scores:

- **a-score**: A complexity assessment using a Large Language Model (LLM).
- **b-score**: Based on Single Level of Abstraction (SLA) principle popularized.

### A-Score

The a-score leverages an LLM to assess your code's complexity. It considers various factors, with more complex code typically resulting in a higher score. Major contributors to high complexity include complicated algorithms, heavy use of third-party libraries, or advanced coding techniques like functional programming that require deep technical expertise to understand. Complicated business logic that demands specific domain knowledge also adds to the complexity.Issues like deeply nested control structures, long methods, or even inconsistent naming can contribute to a higher complexity rating. 

It's also sensitive to code quality best practices—things like avoiding global variables, reducing recursion, or staying away from "magic numbers." The a-score helps you get a clearer picture of how maintainable or complicated your codebase is from a technical perspective.

The overall score for a project should ideally be below **3** to ensure the code is maintainable and easy to understand. However, some files that involve more advanced or domain-specific logic may range between **3 and 4**. The default threshold for the a-score across the whole project is **3.3**, meaning the codebase should strive to keep its complexity below this level, but you can adjust this based on your team's needs.

### B-Score [BETA]

The b-score evaluates your code’s according to the Single Level of Abstraction (SLA) principle promoted by Uncle Bob’s *Clean Code*. The tool analyzes the abstraction levels in your code and assigns a score based on whether functions are mixing high- and low-level operations.

According to the SLA principle, each function should ideally operate at a single level of abstraction. However, having just one level per function is not always a practical or desirable goal. The **b-score** reflects the average number of abstraction layers per function in your codebase. A good target is to aim for around **2** abstraction layers per function, allowing for some flexibility while maintaining clarity. The default threshold for the b-score is **2.5**, which means if your project’s average abstraction level exceeds this value, refactoring may be necessary to make the code more readable and maintainable.

## CLI Configuration

The CLI uses environment variables and accepts multiple arguments and flags.

### Environment Variable

- `CODEPASS_OPEN_AI_KEY`: Required for OpenAI API requests.

### CLI Arguments and Flags

The CLI follows a specific convention for enabling and disabling boolean flags:
- Use `-f` / `--flag` to enable a flag.
- Use `--no-f` / `--no-flag` to disable the flag.

This applies to all boolean flags in the tool.

```bash
-a, --a-score                           # Enable A score (default: True), disable with --no-a-score
-b, --b-score               # Enable B score (default: False), disable with --no-b-score
-ps, --print-improvement-suggestions    # Enable print of improvement suggestions (default: false), disable with --no-print-improvement-suggestions 
-at, --a-score-threshold                # Set A score threshold (default: 3.3)
-bt, --b-score-threshold                # Set B score threshold (default: 2.5)
-c,  --clear                            # Clear existing reports and re-evaluate all files (default: False)
-d, --details                           # Add details for every function into report file (default: False)
-e, --error-info                        # Add debug error message to report file (default: False)
-i, --improvement-suggestions           # Add improvement suggestion to report file (default: False)
```

### Configuration File

The tool supports a `codepass.config.yaml` file for configuration. It includes the same options as CLI flags and an additional option:

- `ignore_files` - An array of glob patterns to exclude certain files from evaluation.

## Poetry Setup

The project is managed using **Poetry**, a dependency management and packaging tool for Python. Follow these steps to set up and work with the project.

### Installing Dependencies

To install all project dependencies defined in the `pyproject.toml` file, run:

```bash
poetry install
```

This will create a virtual environment and install all the necessary packages, including development dependencies.

### Activating the Virtual Environment

To use the project’s virtual environment created by Poetry, activate it with:

```bash
poetry shell
```

Alternatively, you can run commands within the environment without explicitly activating it:

```bash
poetry run <command>
```

For example, to run the CLI tool:

```bash
poetry run codepass --a-score --b-score --recommendation
```

### Install locally

You can install CLI locally by building with `poetry build` and installing package from a `dist/codepass-[x.y.z].tag.gz` with `pip install dist/codepass-[x.y.x].tar.gz` where `[x.y.z]` - represents version of the package.

### Adding New Dependencies

To add new dependencies to the project, use the following command:

```bash
poetry add <package>
```

For development dependencies, append `--dev`:

```bash
poetry add --dev <package>
```

## Features

- **Configurable thresholds**: You can set thresholds for a/b-scores to fail a CI job based on code quality.
- **Progressive mode**: By default, the tool evaluates only new or changed files. Use the `--clear` flag to clear the report and re-evaluate all files.

## Example Usage

### Terminal Output
```
Analyzing files: 14
Changed files: 3
Progress 100% 
Done: 13.9s
Improvement Suggestions: 

File: astrogpt/handler/llm_reasoning/collect_data.py

Suggestion: Refactor the collect_data function by breaking it down into smaller functions that handle specific tasks, such as handling user input, updating user information, and managing actions taken. This will reduce its cognitive complexity and improve readability.
