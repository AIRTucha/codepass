Analyze the given code and provide suggestions to reduce its cognitive complexity. 

Prioritize factors of cognitive complexity in the following order:

1. Advanced coding techniques (like functional programming paradigms) that are not essential for solving the task but reflect the developerâ€™s preference.
2. Deep technical domain knowledge required, such as advanced algorithms, parallel programming, signal processing, or low-level optimizations.
3. Project-specific knowledge is required, such as the use of third-party libraries or specific business rules
4. Control structures and expressions
5. Readable the code is based on factors like naming conventions, formatting, and non-runtime characteristics
